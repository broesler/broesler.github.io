Hey, there! I'm Bernie Roesler. I spent a good chunk of my life studying
engineering sciences and fluid mechanics at the [Thayer School of
Engineering][thayer-school] at [Dartmouth College][dartmouth], and 
consulting at [E<sup>*x*</sup>ponent][exponent] in the [Thermal Sciences
Practice][thermal]. 

I've had these piles of notes, derivations, code snippets, and general ramblings
stored away on my computer for my own reference, but figured they would be more
useful and enjoyable to others if I put them out into the world (wide web). 

Feel free to contact me through any of my social links:

Thanks for reading!
