You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd

def print_hi(name):
  """Print a message to STDOUT."""
  print(f"Hi, {name}.")
  # Do some math. This is a super duper long line of code that won't fit on screen.
  y = 10_000
  x = 2 * y
  return x**y

>>> print_hi('Bernie')
Hi, Bernie
{% endhighlight %}

This is some pretty math:

$$ \tau = \sqrt{\frac{\ell}{g}} $$

that describes the period of a simple harmonic pendulum with period $\tau$. [Here is a much longer
sample of code.]( https://github.com/broesler/18.650-Fundamentals-of-Statistics/blob/904cdd849766273aded16b3a9aa5a9c0f6802df9/hw7/hw7_kstest.py#L75-L124)
